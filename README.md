# weathers

A new Flutter project.

## Running the App

### On an Emulator


Start your emulator from Android Studio or the command line:

    ```sh
    flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
    ```

    Or, if using VS Code, you can start an emulator from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) by searching for `Flutter: Launch Emulator`.
 Run the app:

    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
